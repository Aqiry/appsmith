# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly.When you want to report a vulnerability, the first thing you need to do is find the right contact to send your report to. 
If you find a security vulnerability in the Appsmith project, please report it responsibly by sending an email to security@appsmith.com.

## What to put in your report
The more information you put into your report, the better it is for us. That doesn’t mean you should search for sensitive data to prove the vulnerabilitys , though it’s our responsibility to do that. If you have concerns about something in particular, let us know. We can assess the situation ourselves.
## Thank You
At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
